FountOfEvil
================

This plugin for Spigot / Bukkit lets server operators define custom spawn locations. This is useful for making boss levels, such as you'd find in an RPG.

To set up a spawn point, for example a place to spawn 3 ghasts regularly:

* go to the location where you want the spawning to occur
* type /fount add ghast 3 NewGhastPlace
* stand back! Ghasts are coming :)
